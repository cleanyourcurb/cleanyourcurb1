        <h1>What Can You Do?</h1>
            <p>Currently there are not enough trash bins to accommodate all the neighborhoods. New residential developments in our neighborhood will increase our population by 10,000+.</p> <p>Due to a shortage of trash cans within the 1122 zip code, pedestrians can walk upwards of 15 minutes before reaching a trash can on commercial streets like Franklin Street and McGuinness Boulevard. Many people walking streets without cans create their own out of bike baskets or tree pits.
            <p>There are no recycling bins in Greenpointâ€™s sidewalks, and a small amount in McCarren Park. The lack of recycling opportunities causing us to cram recyclables into already overburdened trash cans.</p>
            <p>Manhattan and Nassau Avenue have cans on every corner. On most days, however, these cans are overflowing with trash.</p>
            <p>All of the public trash cans in the neighborhood are open baskets that allow lightweight trash like plastic bags and coffee cups to blow out and become litter.</p>
