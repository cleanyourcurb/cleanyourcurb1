 <h2>Purpose Of Clean Your Curb</h2>
        <p id="purp">The large amounts of waste being dumped daily not only causes problems with groundwater contamination, animal poisoning, but it can also bring down property values leading to less people wanting to live in that area. What can be described as an eyesore that clogs drainage systems, blocks walkways, and can create health and fire hazards in addition to graffiti, unwanted furniture, and broken down cars makes our society seem that it just doesnâ€™t care. Problems including crime, will increase as areas become trashed. Families with reasonable living standards will not live near trash infested areas. </p>

    <p>"I feel that whenever someone leaves a pile a trash or unwanted furniture out on the street, it just shows how little people are concerned and how slowly our society is becoming less and less developed.</p>
